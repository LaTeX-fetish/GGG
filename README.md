SRS GGG Project

This project is intended to scrape data from quickmeme web pages and submissions. See subreddit /r/SRSUMAD.

There are two Java files: retrieveViews and readIO. retrieveViews is intended to get all information related
to a particular meme submission. readIO is for compiling a list of meme IDs. Yes they're terrible names.
